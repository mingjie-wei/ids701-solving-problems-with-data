    "# A/B Testing the Udacity Website\n",
    "\n",
    "In these exercises, we'll be analyzing data on user behavior from an experiment run by Udacity, the online education company. More specifically, we'll be looking at a test Udacity ran to improve the onboarding process on their site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Udacity's test is an example of an \"A/B\" test, in which some portion of users visiting a website (or using an app) are randomly selected to see a new version of the site. An analyst can then compare the behavior of users who see a new website design to users seeing their normal website to estimate the effect of rolling out the proposed changes to all users. While this kind of experiment has it's own name in industry (A/B testing), to be clear it's just a randomized experiment, and so everything we've learned about potential outcomes and randomized experiments apply here. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Udacity has generously provides the data from this test under an Apache open-source license, and you can find their [original writeup here](https://www.kaggle.com/tammyrotem/ab-tests-with-python/notebook). If you're interested in learning more on A/B testing in particular, it seems only fair while we use their data to flag they have a full course on the subject [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257).)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Udacity's Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The test [is described by Udacity as follows](https://www.kaggle.com/tammyrotem/ab-tests-with-python/notebook): \n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the course overview page: \"start free trial\", and \"access course materials\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Conditions Before Change**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the student clicks \"start free trial\", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first.\n",
    "- If the student clicks \"access course materials\", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description of Experimented Change**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked \"start free trial\", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course.\n",
    "- If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free.\n",
    "- At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead. This [screenshot](images/udacity_checkyoureready.png) shows what the experiment looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Udacity's Hope is that...**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough time -- without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.\n"

    "1. Did Udacity achieve their goal?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Udacity's primary goal was to reduce the number of \"frustrated students\" (those who enroll but don't finish) without significantly reducing the number of students who eventually pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "- OEC (Frustration Rate): Output shows an ATE of -1.5888. This means the intervention reduced the frustration rate by about 1.59 percentage points. However, the p-value is 0.1319. Since this is greater than 0.05, we cannot say this reduction is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Guardrail (Net Conversion): Output shows an ATE of -0.4897 with a p-value of 0.5928. This suggests that the intervention did not have a statistically significant negative impact on the number of paying students, which is good.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conclusion: Strictly speaking, they did not achieve their goal in a statistically significant way. While the frustration rate trended downward, we cannot be confident the change wasn't just due to random noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Did their intervention cause any problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "- No. Because the p-value for the Guardrail Metric is very high (0.5928), there is no evidence that the intervention significantly hurt Udacity's revenue or the number of students completing the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What would you say if they asked \"What would happen if we rolled this out to everyone?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- While the prompt seems to be moving the metrics in the right direction (reducing frustration without hurting revenue), the current data does not provide enough evidence to guarantee this result at scale. We might:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Running the experiment longer to increase statistical power.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Refining the intervention to make the time-commitment warning more impactful.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Are two-tailed p-values appropriate for your OEC?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Because Udacity has a directional hypothesis (they specifically want to reduce the number of frustrated students), one could argue that a one-tailed test is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we used a one-tailed test, our OEC p-value would be halved ($0.1319 / 2 \\approx 0.066$). While this is much closer to the 0.05 threshold, it still doesn't quite reach conventional significance."

    "\n",
    "- Previous Finding: In the simple comparison (Exercise 11), the p-value for the OEC (Frustration Rate) was 0.1319, which failed to meet the standard 0.05 threshold for significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- New Finding: By adding date indicators, the p-value for the treatment effect dropped to 0.025. This means we can now reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the intervention had a statistically significant effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Increased Precision (Reduced Noise)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The standard error for the treatment effect decreased from 0.0104 to 0.0066.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This precision gain occurred because the date indicators \"soaked up\" the day-to-day variation in user behavior that was previously treated as random noise. By accounting for which day an observation occurred, the model could more accurately isolate the specific impact of the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Final Recommendation for Udacity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Roll Out the Change: The intervention successfully reduced the \"Frustration Rate\" (students enrolling without enough time) by approximately 1.6 percentage points (coef = -0.0159).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Business Impact: Since the previous checks showed no significant negative impact on the number of paying students (the Guardrail Metric), Udacity should implement this feature. It improves the student experience and coaching efficiency without hurting the bottom line."
