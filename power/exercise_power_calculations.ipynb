    "\n",
    "When you read about them in a book, power calculations can feel very abstract. To make the concept more concrete, and to give you a chance to familiarize yourself with power calculation tools and the considerations that go into power calculations, in this exercise you will play the role of an experiment planner hired by a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) named [Bandhan](https://www.bandhan.org/) in West Bengal, India. Bandhan is planning to roll out a program that provides livestock, cash, and some basic training to households in extreme poverty. They hope to demonstrate the value of cash and asset transfers, and so wish their program to take the form of a randomized experiment, with data being collected on both control and treatment households.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job will be to help them estimate how many households they should enroll in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was, in fact, a real program, and so the data you will be working with comes from the actual program (conducted in 2007, with followup data collection in 2010, 2017, and 2020), allowing us to do some retrospective comparison of your power calculations and what actually occurred."

    "## The Context\n",
    "\n",
    "> Development economics has long posited that the poor may be poor for no good reason other than the fact that they started poor. This is the idea of a poverty trap, which has the implication that a one-time capital grant that makes very poor households significantly less poor (\"big push\") might set off a virtuous cycle that takes them out of poverty. Forty-three countries now embrace some version of this idea and make large transfers to over 3.1 million of their poorest households. In particular, the \"Targeting the Ultra Poor\" (TUP) intervention, pioneered by BRAC in Bangladesh, employs a multifaceted approach, offering poor households an asset transfer, consumption support, savings, and training in the hopes of unlocking a poverty trap.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [*Long-Term Effects of the Targeting the Ultra Poor Program*](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/aeri.20200667.pdf), Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, and Garima Sharma, 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2007, Bandhan in West Bengal, India created a pilot program to provide direct, unconditional transfers of productive livestock and a 30 or 40 week stipend of 90 rupees a week (about 7 US dollars a week using the [Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity) exchange rate). The program targeted the poorest households in these villages based on range of criteria, and the average eligible household was later estimated to have a consumption level of about 1.35 2018 US Dollars per capita per day in PPP terms $.^1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the goal of the program was, in significant part, to demonstrate the effect of direct asset transfers, Bandhan identified twice as many eligible households as it could support in the pilot and randomly selected half of the households to act as controls and half to be treated $.^2$ Treated households were offered assets from a menu of options, from the most common choice was productive livestock (e.g., cows and goats). $^3$ Bandhan's contact with the households came to an end 18 months after the households were initially provided their livestock and cash transfers began.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although data was collected on a huge range of attributes of the households in this program, our focus will be on per capita household expenditures in 2018 US Dollars (PPP). \n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that these households certainly were not buying their food with dollars, and in most cases they weren't even buying most of their food with rupees — consumption estimates in this type of study are calculated by collecting detailed data on what household members have consumed in the past week, then estimating the price one would pay to buy those goods in local markets and using [PPP conversion rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity) conversion rates to convert that into US Dollars).\n"

So it's certainly pretty big in proportion to the baseline level of expenditures. But whether it's a \"lot\" is actually not a technical question, it's a substantive one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of a Minimal Detectable Effect is to pick the smallest effect size that you'd care about detecting. That way if the true effect *is* the MDE, then when you reject the null you'd want to take some kind of action based on the result (e.g., scale up the program). And if the true effect is smaller, you'd be ok with your inability to reject the null hypothesis since the effect is small enough you wouldn't want to change what you're doing (e.g., you *wouldn't* want to scale up the program).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you set the MDE too high, you may run an under-powered experiment where you miss out on learning that your treatment was effective; if you set the MDE too low, you're spending time and money collecting more data than is necessary given you might reject the null at a point estimate where you still wouldn't scale up the treatment.\n",

    "## Part 2: How Good Are These Guesses?\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest challenge with power calculations like these is that they are subject to lots of source of uncertainty. It's not just that power itself is a probabilistic concept (recall power is the *probability* you will the true effect is precisely the minimimal detectable effect you specified); the problem is that we are using estimates of population parameters as inputs to these calculations and formulas based on distributional assumptions. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We are *estimating* the true population mean from a sample of observations,\n",
    "2. We are *estimating* the true population standard deviation from a sample of observations,\n",
    "3. Our models *assume* our outcomes variables are normally distributed (i.e. modelling uncertainty).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, as our sample size gets larger, each of these assumptions becomes less of a problem — the uncertainty in our estimates of the population mean and standard deviation will shrink and t-tests become robust to outcomes that are not normally distributed when samples become large enough (i.e., t-tests are asymptotically robust to outcomes that are not normal since the sampling distribution of the *mean* of a population converges to normal thanks to the Central Limit Theorem).\n",
    "\n",
    "But all three of these mean that there's substantial uncertainty underlying these apparently clean predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most people never pause to reflect on this. You run a power calculation, it tells you the probability you'd reject the null if you had a Minimal Detectable Effect of a given value, and you use these values to plan an experiment. You run the experiment, and you get a result. And by that point you've largely forgotten about your power calculation and are focused on the results you now have. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of this study (Bandhan), because we have data from the final survey result, we can use the experiment's results to do some simulations to see how things may have turned out in different situations. Moreover, because the actual experiment — as run in West Bengal — was quite overpowered (they had a lot more observations than they needed to reject the null at standard levels), we have a reasonably precise estimate of the true effect size, which is important to make this work. \n",
    "\n",
    "To reiterate: what we're now doing is a kind of \"after-action report\" / post-mortem on our power calculations. Everything we do below relies on the results of the experiment, which you (and the Bandhan team) would obviously not have had at the time you were doing your power calculations. This is the kind of thing we can only do *after* an experiment has been run, and its value is largely to help you think about uncertainty in power calculations the next time you're doing power calculations."

    "### Exercise 9\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we used for our power calculations above came from a baseline survey done before anyone received cash transfers. It's the kind of data collection and analysis you do *before* launching an experiment to help determine how big a sample you need in your experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "But because this team *did* run their cash transfer experiment, we have access to data on how things turned out. In particular, the variables in this data with the suffix `_el3` (short for \"end-line 3\") are results from surveys collected 7 years after households received their first cash transfers. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, we will treat the difference in `pc_exp_month_el3` between the `treatment == 1` and `treatment == 0` groups as the \"true\" effect of the experiment. Technically this is an estimated quantity, so there is some uncertainty around this estimate, but the standard error of the estimate of the effect size is ~1/6 of the effect size, the precision is good enough we can \"pretend\" it's the true effect size for our purposes (especially given what comes next).\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate what we will call the \"true\" effect of the experiment (avg difference in `pc_exp_month_el3` between treatment and control). Store this as `ex9_true_effect`. \n"

    "\n",
    "The idea of the \"power\" of a test is that, when we draw a sample from a population, there's some variation in who happens to end up in that sample. Consequently, even if the *true* effect size in the population is equal to our Minimal Detectable Effect, there's some probability that when we compare treated and untreated outcomes for the $N$ people who actually end up in the study, that Minimal Detectable Effect may not be evident in that sample (at the level of statistical significance $\\alpha$ we have chosen).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that, one way to think of power is: \"If the true effect in the population is our Minimal Detectable Effect, then if I were able to re-run this experiment over and over — drawing new people into the study and testing the difference in outcomes between the control and treated sample each time — then in what percentage of those instances of the experiment would I reject the null hypothesis of no effect?\" Power of 80% means that we'd expect to reject the null of no effect in 80% of those many experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we can basically do that thought experiment with this data! \n",
    "\n",
    "To do the experiment you did the power calculations for in Exercise 11, we just need to sample 35 observations from the treated group and 35 from the control group, treat that as our experimental sample, and estimate the difference in per capita month expenditures between those two groups (along with the associated p-value).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can repeat that over and over to simulate \"re-running\" the experiment, each time drawing a new sample of 35 treated observations and 35 control observations. Then we can store the p-values from all these \"re-run\" experiments and see how often we reject the null of no effect!\n",
    "\n",
    "Two small details for the autograder:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When drawing your sample of 35 observations, draw from observations for which `pc_exp_month_el3` is not missing.\n",
    "- In your t-test, please use equal variance t-test. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are arguments for both strategies in this context, but for the autograder is just important we all do the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when you do this experiment, we have to sample our 35 observations from each treatment arm *with replacement*, just as you would when bootstrapping (this is basically a version of bootstrapping). \n",
    "\n",
    "So: write a loop where, on each pass, you draw 35 observations (with replacement) from treatment and 35 from control, then calculate the treatment effect and p-value for that sample. \n",

    "These results show that analytic power calculations are highly sensitive to how the effect size is standardized. My initial analytic power (≈0.95) was inflated because I standardized the endline-3 treatment–control mean difference using the baseline standard deviation, which understates the variability of endline-3 expenditures and therefore overstates the standardized effect size. In contrast, the bootstrap directly resamples the empirical endline-3 outcome distribution and runs the t-test each time, so it naturally reflects the higher endline-3 variability, yielding an empirical power of about 0.50.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discrepancy is explained by the fact that the endline-3 standard deviation (≈46.64) is almost twice the baseline standard deviation (≈24.26), i.e., sd_el3/sd_bl ≈ 1.92. Once I re-standardized the effect using the endline-3 SD, the analytic power dropped to ≈0.47, which closely matches the bootstrapped estimate (~0.50). This indicates the gap was driven primarily by a mismatch in the variance used for standardization rather than a failure of the analytic method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward, these results will shape my approach to power calculations in three ways: (1) I will ensure the SD used for standardization matches the outcome and time period of interest (e.g., endline SD for endline outcomes); (2) I will perform sensitivity analyses over plausible ranges of effect sizes and variances; and (3) when distributional assumptions may be questionable (heavy tails, heteroskedasticity, outliers), I will use simulation-based checks (bootstrap/Monte Carlo) to validate analytic power calculations, using the effective sample size after accounting for missingness."

    "1. The poorest households were identified in two steps. First, residents across 120 village hamlets ranked households into five wealth quintiles. Among households ranked in the bottom quintile, Bandhan then verified eligibility per seven criteria: (i) presence of an able-bodied female member (to manage the asset), (ii) no credit access, (iii) landholding below 0.2 acres, (iv) no ownership of productive assets, (v) no able-bodied male member, (vi) presence of school-aged children who were working instead of attending school, and (vii) primary source of income being informal labor or begging. Households had to meet the first two criteria and at least three of the remaining five in order to be eligible for the TUP intervention.\n",
    "2. The [ethics of randomization in these types of programs](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/resource/ethical-conduct-randomized-evaluations) is subject of a rich literature, and there are currently an extensive set of guidelines used by researchers developing these types of programs.\n",

Households that accepted the offers might differ systematically from those that do not, so the study simply compares those *offered* the transfer to those who did not). This is what's called an estimate of the \"intention to treat\" effect, and is thus *likely* an under-estimate of the effect of cash transfers that would be observed if uptake were greater."
